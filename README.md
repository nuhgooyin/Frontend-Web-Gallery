# Frontend Web Gallery

A single-page dynamic application with a mobile-first, responsive design, that allows users to post/delete images, make/delete comments, and browse other posted images. All code (JS, HTML & CSS) was created from scratch. No web development libraries or frameworks were used.

## Notes

* Uses local storage to store posts, images, and comments.
* Deployed using GitHub Actions.
* See the extended backend version (i.e. using node.js, express.js, and sequelize) here: [Backend Web Gallery](https://github.com/nuhgooyin/Backend-Web-Gallery)
